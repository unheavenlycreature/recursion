# Recursion

This directory contains my solution for the [recursion project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion?ref=lnav)on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Fibonacci
The [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a mathematical sequence with the following recurrence relation:

> $F_0 = 0$ \
> $F_1 = 1$ \
> $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n - 2}$

The file `fibonacci.rb` contains two functions that can produce the nth fibonacci number, one using recursion and one using an iterative approach.

## Merge Sort
[Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is a [divide-and-conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) sorting algorithm with worst-case runtime $O(n * log (n))$.

The file `merge_sort.rb` contains an implementation of the function.
