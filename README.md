# Recursion

This directory contains my solution for the [recursion project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion?ref=lnav)on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Fibonacci
The [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a mathematical sequence with the following recurrence relation:

![equation](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/bc/ql_ac7db37a11d23ab80dc728e32f4cd6bc_l3.png)

The file `fibonacci.rb` contains two functions that can produce the first `n` fibonacci numbers for the given value of `n`.

## Merge Sort
[Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is a [divide-and-conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) sorting algorithm with worst-case runtime ![runtime](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/f1/ql_4bd2553db899ce6107a5afde9d15f5f1_l3.png).



The file `merge_sort.rb` contains an implementation of the function.
